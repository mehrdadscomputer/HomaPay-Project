# HomaPay-Project

In this project, I have tried to implement the object oriented version of shopping cart using Java programming language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

I used an in-memory database named H2 which is really simple to install and run.
You can find a good description of it here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-memory_database
for further toturials and installation manual, visit here:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/h2_database/index.htm

Also you need Java JDK to be installed on your machine.
use these commands to verify java and javac instalation:
```
java -version
javac -version
```
Oterwise, follow the instruction here to install them.
